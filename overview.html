Do you like to have fun? Do you like math and problem solving? Bring some friends (and some bread) and join us for our first annual online math modeling jam! Through workshops that'll introduce you to topics such as data visualization in Python and problem solving through math modeling, your group will be able to design and develop a model of your own. Each group will address a real-world problem using data analysis and math. Join us from April 24th to April 25th for the Massachusetts Math Modeling Jam! 

Participation is free and via Zoom. Learn more and register at: mmmjam.github.io! 

You can register alone or with a group of 3-4 people. We will host additional workshops in the weeks leading up to the jam; the competition is 24 hours on the weekend. Excited to see you there!
